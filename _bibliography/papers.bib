  title={Direct Estimation of Differential Functional Gaussian Graphical Models},
  author={Zapata, Javier and Oh, Sang-Yun and Petersen, Alex},
  abstract={It is of interest to understand the difference between functional connectivity maps of the brain under different tasks. For such purpose, we consider the problem of estimating the difference between two functional graussian graphical models directly. Motivated by the assumption of partial separability for multivariate functional data we propose the joint differential graphical lasso, which is a new method to estimates the difference between graphical models. Empirical performance of the method is assessed through simulation and analysis of functional brain connectivity during a motor task for the left and right.},

@article{zapataFGM,
  title={Partial Separability and Functional Graphical Models for Multivariate Gaussian Processes},
  author={Zapata, Javier and Oh, Sang-Yun and Petersen, Alex},
  abstract={The covariance structure of multivariate functional data can be highly complex, especially if the multivariate dimension is large, making extension of statistical methods for standard multivariate data to the functional data setting quite challenging. For example, Gaussian graphical models have recently been extended to the setting of multivariate functional data by applying multivariate methods to the coefficients of truncated basis expansions. However, a key difficulty compared to multivariate data is that the covariance operator is compact, and thus not invertible. The methodology in this paper addresses the general problem of covariance modeling for multivariate functional data, and functional Gaussian graphical models in particular. As a first step, a new notion of separability for multivariate functional data is proposed, termed partial separability, leading to a novel Karhunen-Loève-type expansion for such data. Next, the partial separability structure is shown to be particularly useful in order to provide a well-defined Gaussian graphical model that can be identified with a sequence of finite-dimensional graphical models, each of fixed dimension. This motivates a simple and efficient estimation procedure through application of the joint graphical lasso. Empirical performance of the method for graphical model estimation is assessed through simulation and analysis of functional brain connectivity during a motor task. },

@article{zapataCDOs,
  title={On the Stability of Synthetic CDO Credit Ratings},
  author={Zapata, Javier and Cifuentes, Arturo},
  abstract={Synthetic collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) performed very badly during the subprime crisis: they suffered massive rating downgrades (even at the most senior levels of the capital structure) and inflicted significant losses on investors. Using numerical simulations, this study shows that such structures are highly unstable; minor errors in the basic assumptions could manifest dramatically in the accuracy of CDO rating calculations. Regardless of the quality of the underlying assets, it is impossible to make reliable statements regarding the future performance of a synthetic CDO tranche. Moreover, this study demonstrates that single‐point credit risk estimators (in which no attempt at specifying a confidence interval is made) could be especially misleading. Finally, the study suggests that a regulatory framework based on credit ratings as they are presently defined is unlikely to be effective.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
