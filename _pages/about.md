I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Statistics & Applied Probability at University of California, Santa Barbara. My advisor is Prof. [Sang-Yun Oh](http://www.pstat.ucsb.edu/faculty/syoh/). My doctoral research is on high-dimensional statistics for functional brain connectivity. For more details regarding my research, please check the [publications page](/al-folio/publications/).

During my time at UCSB I have gained practical experience in machine learning with different internships. In Summer '19 I worked as a Quantitative Analyst Intern at [Western Asset Management](http://www.westernasset.com) developing an anomaly detection method for fixed-income analytics  for over 120K bonds in 33 currencies. And in Summer '17 I interned as a Data Scientist at [SimpliRoute](https://www.simpliroute.com/en/home) where I implemented a predictor model of the discharging time of multi-stop delivery route plans. For more details, check out [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/javier-zapata-2710/)

At UC Santa Barbara I have also served as a Teaching Assistant since 2015 in many upper division and graduate courses including: Stochastic Processes, Big Data Analytics, Data Science, Time Series and Statistical Machine Learning. Moreover, I also worked as a R/Shiny Web Developer at UC Santa Barbara. I'm developing a repository of interactive web-based learning applications for probability and statistics undergraduate courses.  Please check the [teaching page](/al-folio/teaching/) for more details.

Before joining UC Santa Barbara, I majored in Industrial Engineering at the University of Chile. My thesis advisor was Prof. [Arturo Cifuentes](https://arturocifuentes.com/). I studied credit risk metrics for structured debt instruments.
